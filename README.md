<h2>Chat with react, redux and websocket</h2>

- clone project
- open two folders: client and server
- open two consoles in these two directories
- install required modules by 'npm i'
- start script: 'npm chat' - in client directory and 'node app' - in server's
- since you are on a local server, open several tabs in browser to simulate multiple users
